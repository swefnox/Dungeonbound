An entry for a Game Off 2019 game jam. Theme - Leaps and bounds

This is a Game Maker Studio 2 project of my entry for Game Off 2019.

The theme was "Leaps and bounds." In my case I approached it in a following way:
- the character leaps into helping her freinds,
- the character obtains powerful artefacts that allow her to confront the lich and save her friends,
- the dungeon is disappearing (creates bonds),
- the artefacts are cursed, limitng what character can do.

The game is a combination of a simple puzzle game (collecting the artefacts) and
choose your own adventure kind of game (once the dungeon disappears, the hero fights the lich).

The game is by no means fully finished. It lacks full graphics, in some places you can find placeholders.
Also there seem to be some bugs with the final part.

One of the planned features was the lich taunting can commenting on the player actions in the dungeon.

Possibly I'm going to add that part later.

Controls:
DIRECTIONS: arrows / WSAD / gamepad's left analog stick, gamepad's d-pad
SELECT: enter / space / A, B, X, or Y button on the gamepad.
